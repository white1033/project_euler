# Distinct Powers

## Problem Statement

Consider all integer combinations of $a^b$ for $2 \le a \le 5$ and $2 \le b \le 5$:

$$ 2^2=4, 2^3=8, 2^4=16, 2^5=32 $$
$$ 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243 $$
$$ 4^2=16, 4^3=64, 4^4=256, 4^5=1024 $$
$$ 5^2=25, 5^3=125, 5^4=625, 5^5=3125 $$

If they are then placed in numerical order, with any repeats removed, we get the following sequence of 15 distinct terms:
4, 8, 9, 16, 25, 27, 32, 64, 81, 125, 243, 256, 625, 1024, 3125.

How many distinct terms are in the sequence generated by $a^b$ for $2 \le a \le 100$ and $2 \le b \le 100$?

## Analysis

We need to count the number of unique values in the set $\{a^b \mid 2 \le a \le 100, 2 \le b \le 100\}$.

### Brute Force Approach
Since the upper bound for $a$ and $b$ is only 100, the total number of combinations is $(100-1) \times (100-1) = 9801$.
The maximum value is $100^{100}$, which has 201 digits. Modern computers (and Python) handle arithmetic of this size instantly.

We can simply generate all $a^b$, insert them into a `set` (which automatically handles duplicates), and check the size of the set.

### Complexity
*   **Time Complexity**: $O(N^2 \times \log(\text{max\_val}))$, where $N=100$. The $\log$ factor comes from big integer multiplication.
*   **Space Complexity**: $O(N^2 \times \text{size\_of\_big\_int})$.
