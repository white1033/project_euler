# Problem 75: Singular Integer Right Triangles

It turns out that 12 cm is the smallest length of wire that can be bent to form an integer sided right angle triangle in exactly one way, but there are many more examples.

*   **12 cm**: (3,4,5)
*   **24 cm**: (6,8,10)
*   **30 cm**: (5,12,13)
*   **36 cm**: (9,12,15)
*   **40 cm**: (8,15,17)
*   **48 cm**: (12,16,20)

In contrast, some lengths of wire, like 20 cm, cannot be bent to form an integer sided right angle triangle, and other lengths allow more than one solution to be found; for example, using 120 cm it is possible to form exactly three different integer sided right angle triangles.

*   **120 cm**: (30,40,50), (20,48,52), (24,45,51)

Given that L is the length of the wire, for how many values of $L \le 1,500,000$ can exactly one integer sided right angle triangle be formed?

## Analysis

We need to find the number of integer solutions $(a, b, c)$ to:
$$ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 $$
$$ a + b + c = L $$

We can use **Euclid's formula** for generating Pythagorean triples. A primitive triple $(a, b, c)$ (where $\gcd(a, b, c)=1$) is generated by:
$$ a = m^2 - n^2 $$
$$ b = 2mn $$
$$ c = m^2 + n^2 $$
where $m > n > 0$, $\gcd(m, n) = 1$, and $m, n$ have opposite parity (one even, one odd).

The perimeter $L$ for a primitive triple is:
$$ L = a + b + c = (m^2 - n^2) + 2mn + (m^2 + n^2) = 2m^2 + 2mn = 2m(m+n) $$

All Pythagorean triples (primitive and non-primitive) can be formed by scaling a primitive triple by a factor $k$.
$$ L_{total} = k \cdot L_{primitive} = k \cdot 2m(m+n) $$

**Algorithm:**
1.  Initialize an array `counts` of size 1,500,001 with zeros.
2.  Iterate through possible values of $m$ and $n$.
    *   Since $L = 2m(m+n) > 2m^2$, we have $2m^2 < L_{max} \implies m < \sqrt{L_{max}/2}$.
    *   For $L_{max} = 1,500,000$, $m_{max} \approx 866$.
3.  For each valid pair $(m, n)$ generating a primitive triple:
    *   Calculate $L = 2m(m+n)$.
    *   Increment `counts[k * L]` for all $k$ such that $k \cdot L \le L_{max}$.
4.  Finally, count how many indices $i$ in `counts` have `counts[i] == 1`.

This approach ensures we visit each triple exactly once and efficiently tabulate the counts.
